🚕 Ride Booking System using Java (OOP)

I have built a mini Ride Booking System using Java to strengthen my Object-Oriented Programming concepts.

🔹 Concepts Used:
• Classes & Objects
• Inheritance
• Abstraction
• Polymorphism
• Encapsulation
• Packages

🔹 Features:
• User books a ride
• Driver accepts the ride
• Vehicle-based fare calculation (Car/Bike)
• Clean OOP-based design

🔹 Tech Stack:
• Java
• OOP
• Console-based application

📌 This project helped me understand real-world OOP design and package structure in Java.
